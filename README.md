# How to execute and verify automated tests with TestNG

TestNG docs can be foud here: https://testng.org/doc/

This is an example how can TestNG be used in testing.
The goal is to show following parts of TestNG framework:
- annotations
- data providers
- depends on attribute
- parameters
- priority
- hard and soft assertions

The tests (and test code) itself are not important as the goal was to show TestNG. 

**Note: ChromeDriver in the project is for version  between 71 and 75 and Linux.**
